This is an exercise in training DNNs to extract information from satellite images provided by Planet Inc.

The data is composed of images that have been classified as having specific features such as logging, road, rivers,
human settlement, clouds, etc. **Each image can have multiple features embedded within,** and as a first start the task is simply
to determine which subset of features each image contains.

Each image is 512 x 512 and is encoded in 4 channels including NIR.
